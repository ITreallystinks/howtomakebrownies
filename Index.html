<h2>Original Brownies</h2>
<p>Ingredients</p>
<p>1 cup (2 sticks) butter or margarine</p>
<p>2 cups sugar</p>
<p>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</p>
<p>4 eggs</p>
<p>3/4 cup Cocoa Powder</p>

<p>1/4 teaspoon salt</p>

<p>Directions</p>
<p>1. Heat oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit. Grease 13x9x2-inch baking pan.</p>

<h2>Fudgy Brownies</h2>

<p>3/4 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder</p>
<p>1/2 teaspoon of baking soda</p>
<p>2/3 cup of vegetable oil</p>
<p>1/2 cup of boiling water</p>
<p>2 cups of white sugar</p>

<p>2. In a large bowl, stir together the cocoa and baking soda. Add 1/3 cup vegetable oil and boiling water. Mix until well blended and thickened. Stir in the sugar, eggs, and remaining 1/3 cup oil. Finally, add the flour, vanilla and salt; mix just until all of the flour is absorbed. Spread evenly into the prepared pan.</p>
<p>3. Bake in the preheated oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out clean. Allow to cool before cutting into squares.</p>
